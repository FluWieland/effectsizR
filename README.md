# effectsizR
An R-package which assists you to calculate effect size estimates  In this repository you find our finished version of the effectsizR package, which we created to meet the requirements for a seminar on R programming we completed at the University of Berne, under supervision of Dr. Boris Mayer and MSc. Andrew Ellis. The present package enables the user to find an adequate effect size estimate for various statistical procedures. The selection of the right effect size estimate is guided by a wizard operating via dialogue boxes. Also, it is possible to use the various functions for effect size estimate calculation directly.  In order to use the package, execute the following commands in R-Studio:
install.packages('devtools'); 
library(devtools); 
install_github("FluWieland/effectsizR/effectsizR"); 
library(effectsizR); 
To run the wizard, type run_wizard() into your R-Studio console and press Enter.
